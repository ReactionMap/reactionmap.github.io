How to use
=======
0. Resource
---
Rmap files (reaction maps of isomers) can be downloaded from the [resources](https://github.com/ReactionMap/resources) repository.

1. Components of RMapViewer
---

![GUI components](https://sourceforge.net/p/rmapviewer/screenshot/RMapViewer_manual_ui_elements-2014-0306-02.png)

By dropping an .rmap file on the window, the reaction map view shows the map.

2. Zoom in/out, moving view.
---

When the reaction map view has the focus, down-arrow key will magnify the map and up-arrow key will pan it out. You can also use scroll wheel to zoom in/out the map.
Dragging a mouse on the reaction map view will shift the visible scope of the map, which is indicated as a red rectangle in the global map view. The red rectangle is also draggable.

3. Select reactants and products
